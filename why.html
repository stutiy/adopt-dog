			<p class="padding-top-less">Have you heard the latest catch-phrase, “Adopt, Don’t Shop?” If so, you might be wondering what it means. Adopt, Don’t Shop is a campaign slogan that a growing number of animal rights proponents are using to promote adopting pets from shelters, rather than buying them from pet stores. What’s behind the movement? Is it controversial? And how can you get involved? Read on for answers to all these questions and more.</p>
			<p>Most of the puppies sold in pet stores or online originate from puppy mills, commercial dog-breeding facilities that focus on increasing profit with little regard for the health and welfare of the animals. Although puppy mills are legal, a vast majority aren’t regulated. Practices and conditions in most puppy mills are unethical and downright abhorrent in many cases. Dogs live in filthy conditions without adequate food, water or veterinary care. And female dogs are bred at every opportunity with little to no recovery time between litters. Inbreeding is also a huge problem.</p>

			<p>Wondering whether to adopt or buy a dog or cat?</p>

			<p>Adopt don't buy</p>
			<p>There are lots of good reasons to adopt rather than buy a pet. Here are a few of them:</p>

			<p>Buying a pet can easily cost Rs.10,000 to Rs.100,000 or more. Adoption costs range from Rs.100 to Rs.200, depending on whether the pet comes from the city shelter or a rescue group that has spent money on boarding, vets and grooming.</p>
			<p>You’re getting more for your money if you get a mixed breed. Based on the well-established principle of “hybrid vigor,” a mixed-breed animal is likely to live longer and cost less in vet bills than a pure breed. Many purebred dogs are prone to developing health problems ranging from breathing difficulties to hip dysplasia to an enlarged heart.</p>
			<p>A pet purchased from a pet store is a complete unknown. And, once you walk out of the store, you are on your own. Most pet stores don’t provide any support if you have questions or problems with your new pet. When you adopt, especially from a rescue group, you know what you are getting because the group has a history on the animal. The rescue group will also help you through the familiarization period because they are invested in providing a good home for that animal.</p>
			<p>When you adopt a pet, you are saving a life. When you buy a pet, you not only deny a homeless pet a home, you are supporting an industry that thrives on short-changing the welfare of animals. Puppy and kitten mills (which sell to pet stores) are in business to make a profit, so they churn out puppies and kittens as fast as they can. These animals are often in ill-health and have problems like poor socialization skills due to lack of human companionship and genetic defects due to inbreeding. Click here for more information on puppy mills.</p>
			<p>If you adopt, you get your choice of any age. Though puppies and kittens are cute and cuddly, they can also be a handful. An adult or older pet may be a better fit for you. For example, adopting an adult dog who’s already house-trained and knows basic cues is often much easier than adopting a puppy, who must be taught these things.</p>
			<p>You get just as much love (if not more). An adopted pet is every bit as loving, intelligent and loyal as a purchased pet, even if you get an adult or older animal.
			For all of these reasons, adopting rather than buying is pretty much a no-brainer. As Homer Simpson would say, “Doh! I’ll take the adoption … and a donut, please.”</p>
